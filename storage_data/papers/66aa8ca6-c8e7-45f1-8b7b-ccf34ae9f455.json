The output of each sub-layer is $\\text{LayerNorm}(x + \\text{Sublayer}(x))$, where $\\text{Sublayer}(x)$ is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension $d_{model} = 512$. The encoder takes in a sequence of tokens, each represented as a vector of dimension $d_{model}$, and outputs a sequence of vectors, each of dimension $d_{model}$.",

Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions.
