      "query": "what is the approach they are proposing?",
      "response": "The authors of the 'Attention is All You Need' paper are proposing a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, which is based solely on attention mechanisms. This approach dispenses with recurrence and convolutions entirely, marking a significant departure from traditional recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. The Transformer architecture is designed to handle sequential data, such as text, and is particularly well-suited for natural language processing tasks."
